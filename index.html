    <p>
        You have an award-winning garden and every day the plants need exactly 40mm of water. <br>
        You created a great piece of JavaScript to calculate the amount of water your plants <br>
        will need when you have taken into consideration the amount of rain water that is <br>
        forecast for the day. Your jealous neighbour hacked your computer and filled your code <br>
        with bugs.<br>
        <br>
        Your task is to debug the code before your plants die!<br>
